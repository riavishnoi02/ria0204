The todo-list-mamangement-system has been developed mainly with the concepts of Spring MVC and Hibernate.
It depicts basic CRUD functionality along with login page basic functionality.

We have a registration page and a login page .
Only after a successful login will a user be able to see the contents and list of tasks .
A user can add new tasks , update them and delete them from the list .
User can mark the task with different status as well .

Hope you like a short and a simple application which I tried to complete without using any complicated logic and adapting simple and basic approach .


Due to time restrictions , my main agenda was to make the application working .

1. I used simple JSP for front end logics . I would have used java scripts and html to make the presentation look good if time permitted.
2. I used basic sql queries for crud application . I would have made the project much adavanced if I had time .For Example : I would have made a link between the users and tasks table which would have made only those tasks displayed which were assigned to a particular user and not all tasks at one go.
3. I would have made a use of pick date calender for entering date while adding tasks if I had more time.
4. The application is very basic without much use of frountend functionalities available .If I had some more time , I would have invested it in some cosmetic work to enhance the application.
5. I would have added more meaningful comments while coding for others to understand my code logic.
6. I would have added a better security structure in passwords if I had more time .

FYI :
I have used mysql for hibernate connectivity
username is :springstudent
password is : springstudent



Thanks.
